      <h1>Health</h1>
      <p>
        <font color="#E6222B">Ensuring good health</font> is pivotal for a
        fulfilling life, yet India grapples with widespread health issues,
        including malnutrition, infant, and maternal mortality. Despite
        constitutional guarantees for free healthcare, over 70% of health
        expenses are borne by individuals, creating a significant financial
        burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing this challenge, AD Life has focused its efforts on
        healthcare, particularly targeting tribal populations,
        <font color="#E6222B"
          >constituting 7.95% of India's total population</font
        >. Working in Telangana,
      </p>
      <p>
        AD Life has provided essential health services to
        <font color="#E6222B">25,000 tribal individuals,</font> collaborating
        with local gram panchayats in <font color="#E6222B">30 villages</font>.
        Medical camps facilitated access to general physicians, cardiologists,
        pediatricians, and gynecologists, benefitting
        <font color="#E6222B">9,467 tribal members</font>. Eye and dental camps
        further addressed specific health needs.

        Additionally,
        <font color="#E6222B">AD Life prioritizes community well-being</font> by
        employing and training four counselors who have supported 350 families
        in health-related matters, emphasizing government health services,
        HIV/AIDS counseling, and nutrition. In response to the COVID-19
        pandemic,
      </p>
      <p>
        AD Life extended its support by actively participating in
        <font color="#E6222B">track and trace activities for four months</font>.
        The organization collected and compiled data for relevant national
        public health authorities, showcasing a proactive approach to community
        health.

      <p>
        Further demonstrating its commitment, AD Life provided essential medical
        assistance to those adversely affected by the pandemic-induced lockdown,
        contributing to the overall welfare of the community.
