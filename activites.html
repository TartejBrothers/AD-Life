          >transforming the lives of vulnerable children, particularly those
          born to sex workers.</font
        >
        Facing challenges such as higher infant mortality and difficulty
        accessing education due to societal stigma, these children often
        struggle for opportunities. The trust has supported 12 children through
        bachelor's degrees, <font color="#E6222B">breaking</font> the cycle of
        adversity and instilling confidence in their dreams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Addressing gender biases in education, AD Life Trust sponsored the
        initial fees for a deserving young woman pursuing a Ph.D., exemplifying
        its commitment to empowering individuals. The sponsored individual's
        success story, securing a higher-paying job aligned with her research,
        highlights the trust's philosophy of
        <font color="#E6222B">enabling self-sufficiency.</font>

        In recognition of broader educational challenges in India, AD Life Trust
        partnered with <font color="#E6222B">Veda Vedanta Gurukula</font>
        Mahavidyalaya, Guntur. Financial support preserves traditional
        knowledge, Sanskrit language, and fosters higher education in Vedic

      <h1>Health</h1>
      <p>
        <font color="#E6222B">Ensuring good health</font> is pivotal for a
        fulfilling life, yet India grapples with widespread health issues,
        including malnutrition, infant, and maternal mortality. Despite
        constitutional guarantees for free healthcare, over 70% of health
        expenses are borne by individuals, creating a significant financial
        burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing this challenge, AD Life has focused its efforts on
        healthcare, particularly targeting tribal populations,
        <font color="#E6222B"
          >constituting 7.95% of India's total population</font
        >. Working in Telangana, AD Life has provided essential health services
        to <font color="#E6222B">25,000 tribal individuals,</font> collaborating
        with local gram panchayats in <font color="#E6222B">30 villages</font>.
        Medical camps facilitated access to general physicians, cardiologists,
        pediatricians, and gynecologists, benefitting
        <font color="#E6222B">9,467 tribal members</font>. Eye and dental camps
        further addressed specific health needs.
      </p>
      <img src="images/activities/health.png" alt="health" class="fullwidth" />
      <p>
        Additionally,
        <font color="#E6222B">AD Life prioritizes community well-being</font> by
        employing and training four counselors who have supported 350 families
        in health-related matters, emphasizing government health services,
        HIV/AIDS counseling, and nutrition. In response to the COVID-19
        pandemic, AD Life extended its support by actively participating in
        <font color="#E6222B">track and trace activities for four months</font>.
        We collected and compiled data for relevant national public health
        authorities, showcasing a proactive approach to community health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further demonstrating our commitment, AD Life provided essential medical
        assistance to those adversely affected by the pandemic-induced lockdown,
        contributing to the overall welfare of the community.

      <h1>Livelihoods</h1>
      <p>
        AD Life Trust is deeply committed to enhancing livelihoods through skill
        development programs, with a focus on empowering suburban women. Over
        <font color="#E6222B"
          >30 batches, comprising 10 women each, were trained in Akiveedu</font
        >, West Godavari district, mastering skills such as tailoring,
        embroidery, and handicraft making. Through its affiliated, AD Life
        Projects Pvt. Ltd., AD Life Trust established a transformative
        partnership with
        <font color="#E6222B">Brandix India Apparel City</font>, providing
        training for women in garment manufacturing. This collaboration led to
        successful placements in various apparel units, aligning with industry
        needs. With a 3000 square feet training center, AD Life Trust has
        supported the program with experienced
        <font color="#E6222B"
          >trainers, covering essential skills and holistic development.</font

        In tandem, AD Life Trust
        <font color="#E6222B">extended its impact in Vizag district,</font>
        collaborating with <font color="#E6222B">APSSDC</font> to provide
        training and placements in apparel, retailing, hospitality, and
        logistics sectors. Over 60 women received training in sewing skills,
        <font color="#E6222B">with the provision of sewing machines</font> for
        sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The organization's commitment to social impact is further evidenced
        through its collaboration with
        <font color="#E6222B">Save the Children/CWS</font>, implementing the
        Refugees Project in Urban Hyderabad. Despite pandemic challenges, the
        team successfully executed trainings, formed production groups, and
        facilitated the sale of market-ready products.
      </p>
      <p>
        External evaluations underscore the project's success, with positive
        outcomes for <font color="#E6222B">Persons of Concern (PoCs)</font> in

      <h1>Research and Documentation</h1>
      <p>
        AD Life Trust's rapid assessment of the Swacchanda Arogya Nestams (SANs)
        program in Kamareddy district highlights its success in enhancing access
        to government hospital services. The program, initiated in 2017,
        effectively provides patients with information, reducing waiting times
        and inquiry loads while improving hospital atmospheres.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volunteers involved in SANs report a sense of purpose and service. The
        assessment identifies areas for improvement with minimal intervention.
        Additionally, under research and documentation initiatives, AD Life
        conducts assessments for development solutions, partnering with leading
        researchers in India and abroad.

        The organization believes in leveraging data and research to design more
        effective interventions, such as understanding tribal consumption
        behavior and promoting nutritious indigenous food choices. This critical
        work contributes to informed decision-making by NGOs and policymakers.
